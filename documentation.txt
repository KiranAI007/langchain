1). What is Langchain in python?
    Langchain in Python is a powerful framework that allows you to easily create and experiment with applications powered by 
large language models (LLMs). It provides a range of tools and components to simplify the development process, making it accessible 
to both developers and researchers with varying levels of NLP experience.

Unlike standard API calls, Langchain allows you to connect your LLM with various data sources for richer and more personalized 
experiences. Langchain supports various NLP tasks like text summarization, machine translation, question answering, and data augmentation.
It also integrates with popular LLM platforms like OpenAI and Hugging Face, giving you access to a wide range of pre-trained models.

2). There are two main ways to connect Langchain with LLM models.
    Langchain provides pre-built agents for various LLM models like OpenAI's API and Hugging Face transformers. These agents simplify 
the interaction by handling authentication, model selection, and input/output formatting. 
    a). Identify the LLM provider: First, choose the LLM platform you want to use (e.g., OpenAI API, Hugging Face).
    b). Install the relevant library: Install the specific Langchain library for your chosen provider (e.g., langchain.llms.openai for 
    OpenAI).
    c). Configure the agent: Set up the agent with your provider credentials (e.g., API key for OpenAI) and select the desired 
    LLM model.
    d). Use the agent in your workflow: Interact with the LLM through the agent using methods like generate_text or answer_question.

3). What is PromptTemplate?
    PromptTemplate, particularly in the context of Langchain, refers to a specific tool used to create dynamic and reusable prompts 
for Large Language Models (LLMs). Essentially, it allows you to build a template with placeholders instead of writing the entire prompt 
from scratch each time. PromptTemplate in Langchain plays a crucial role in constructing dynamic and reusable prompts for 
Large Language Models (LLMs).
